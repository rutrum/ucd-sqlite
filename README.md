# Unicode Character Database in Sqlite

This project will be a collection of scripts that will pull the unicode character database files locally, then parse them and construct a sqlite database from it for the use of other utilities.

Hopefully this format might make developers of unicode related applications a bit more exposed to all the content provided in the unicode standard.  This includes myself, where I plan to use this sqlite database to create a command line utility for searching it, since I feel that the current options are incomplete, since they do not use all the data available in the unicode character database (UCD).
